# makefileExample
This is an example of how to write a basic makefile to create and compile a .cpp file to make an object file and then an executable file from it.<br />
To run this program, simply clone the repository and unzip the files in a same directory. <br />Then type make on the console and 
press enter, the rest will be done by the make file to create a executable file named driver. <br />
To run the file called driver (on a unix system), type ./driver then press enter.<br />
Hello, World will appear on the screen<br />
To remove the man.o and driver file, type make clean
